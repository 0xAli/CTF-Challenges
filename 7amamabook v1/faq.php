									7amamaBook (formerly [the7amamaBook]) is an online social networking service headquartered in Egypt. 7amamaBook was founded on February 4, 2004, by <a href="profile.php?user=7amamaberg">Mark 7amamaBerg</a> with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students <a href="profile.php?user=7atata">Eduardo 7atata</a>. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students. 7amamaBook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.<br/><br/>
After registering to use the site, users can create a User profile, add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". 7amamaBook had over 1.3 billion active users as of June 2014. Due to the large volume of data collected about users, the service's privacy policies have faced scrutiny, among other criticisms. 7amamaBook, Inc. held its initial public offering in February 2012 and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching a peak market capitalization of $104 billion.
