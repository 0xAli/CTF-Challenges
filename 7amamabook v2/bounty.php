									 <h4>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on 7amamaBook v2, we encourage you to let us know right away.<br/>
									 We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.<h4>
									 <h3>We don't pay for CSRF vulnerability.</h3>
									 <br/>
									 <br/>
									 We pay for serious bugs like:
										<ul>
										<li>Cross Site Scripting</li>
										<li>Broken Authentication (including 7amamaBook v2 OAuth bugs)</li>
										<li>Circumvention of our Platform/Privacy permission models</li>
										<li>Remote Code Execution</li>
										<li>Privilege Escalation</li>
										<li>Provisioning Errors </li>
										</ul>

										<h2>UPDATE: (26/11/2014)</h2>
												
We work hard to keep you safe online. In 7amamaBook v2, for instance, we warn users against malware and phishing and offer rewards for finding security bugs. Due in part to our collaboration with the research community, we’ve squashed more than 700 security bugs and have rewarded more than $1.25 million through our bug reward program. But as 7amamaBook v2 has become more secure, it’s gotten even harder to find and exploit security bugs.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good problem to have! In recognition of the extra effort it takes to uncover vulnerabilities in 7amamaBook v2, we’re increasing our reward levels. We’re also making some changes to be more transparent with researchers reporting a bug.<br/>
<br/>
First, we’re increasing our usual reward pricing range to $500-$15,000 per bug, up from a previous published maximum of $5,000. This is accompanied with a clear breakdown of likely reward amounts by bug type. As always, we reserve the right to reward above these levels for particularly great reports. (For example, last month we awarded $30,000 for a very impressive report.)
